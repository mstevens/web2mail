Design notes
------------

This is all meant to be done using twisted.

It's the SMTP server (obviously!).

Data storage will be postgres.

Signup: email register@host

Does the double-opt-in dance.

Confirmation codes stored in psql.

Help: email help@host

Sends back a help message!

Fetch: get@domain

Body should be a list of urls to fetch.

Stop parsing at something that looks like a sig.

Return one email per page requested.

Non-registered addresses are ignored!

For v1 just send back a plain text rendering.
v2 should send the HTML as well.

Unregister: leave@host

Again, the double-opt-in dance, then remove people.

Do the SPF/DKIM thing via postfix.
